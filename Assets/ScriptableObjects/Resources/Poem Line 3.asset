    and "away" are underlined.
  UseDescription: ' It reads, "To a heart most right and true: Go towards love; from
    fear, away."

  BattleUseDescription: A lovely quote, perhaps, but it really doesn't make much
    sense without the rest of the poem.
  SingleObtainDescription: You found the third line of a poem! It looks like the
    rest was torn off.
